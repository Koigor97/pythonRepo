# pythonRepo
PythonRepo is a repository that houses my journey in learning
Python by building projects. This my own #100 Days of Coding, 
only that I created the repository on the second half of the 
100 days ðŸ˜†. Some of my other projects are on Replit: https://replit.com/@KoigorFogbawa 
. All of my projects are sourced from Angela's Yu "100 days of Code" on Udemy (Highly Recommended). 
The second half is a tough one.
